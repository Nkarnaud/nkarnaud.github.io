# About me

My name is Arnaud Tsombeng and I am a software developer. I specialise in developping web application, 
data scraper, web crawler, data engineering.
my main tech stack include python, flask, django, docker, docker-compose, AWS EC2, AWS ECS, JSON,  
Jenkins, Aws, async, Oauth2, JWT, flask-dance, Postgresql, microservices and Reactjs. 
I've worked as backend developper at Leapture LLC where we use python flask docker and AWS.
I equally worked as frontend developer at Montaxi SAS where I develop frontend of the backoffice.
I currently work as a freelancer were I always ensure that I meet the needs of my clients even 
if it means working extra hours. I equally love learning and regularly staying up to date with new things, 
most especially in the tech domain. My hobbies are listening to music, playing football.
